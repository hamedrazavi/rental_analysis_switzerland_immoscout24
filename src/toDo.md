# To Do

* Write a function that gets the city name and outputs the pandas data frame of the rental data (i.e., a function form of the rental_analysis_switzerland.ipynb) for any city. Note that the immoscoutHtml_to_text_once should also be run for the new cities. 
* From the vega-lite map source generate an html 
* Use the html from the step above and make a web page (perhaps on github.io)
