# To Do

* Write a function that gets the city name and outputs the pandas data frame of the rental data (i.e., a function form of the rental_analysis_switzerland.ipynb) for any city. Note that the immoscoutHtml_to_text_once should also be run for the new cities. 
* Create a map of rental prices over the whole Switzerland
* Update the altair or vega-lite maps based on [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/configuration.html#view-configuration) and [this](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed). 
* In rental_analysis notebook, calculate the average prices for 1 piece, 1.5 piece, 2 pieces. etc. in each zip code. Then it would be interesting to compare the price of, for instance 2 pieces apartment to one piece and see it is not double. Then given for instance a 250 m<sup>2</sup> surface area, and a zip code, what would be an optimum construction plan? Perhaps with the consideration of the federal or local constraints. 
* In the webapplication users can enter the specs of the apartment (e.g., surface area, number of pieces) where they can be as much restrictive as they want, then I list the zip codes and their expected (average) prices for their criteria.  
* Given the budget and desired number of rooms, list the likelihood of getting an apartment each of the zip-codes. 
* From the vega-lite map source generate an html (Done)
* Use the html from the step above and make a web page (perhaps on github.io) (Done)
